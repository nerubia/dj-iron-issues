A bug is a *demonstrable problem* that is caused by the code in the repository.  Good bug reports are **extremely **helpful - tvm!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** - check if the issue has already been reported.
2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** - for developers, try to reproduce it using the latest `master` or `development` branch in the repository.
3. **Add helpful screenshots **- for the general public or QA *this greatly** ***helps developers zero in on the module causing the bug and debug faster.

A **good bug report** shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information.

Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. 

* What is your environment?
* What steps will reproduce the issue?
* What browser(s) and OS experience the problem?
* What would you expect to be the outcome?

All these details will help maintainers fix any potential bugs.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their merits).
